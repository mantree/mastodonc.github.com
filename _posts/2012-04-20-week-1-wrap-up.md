What a week! This startup thing is a lot of fun, but also much more work than having a regular job.

So this week we've spent a lot of time building the beta live carbon ratings engine, which should go live by the start of Big Data Week on Monday. Bruce is coding like a dervish as we speak, to make that happen. He is living the dream of writing Clojure for 12 hours a day right now (at least, he tells me it's a dream).

With perfect timing for our launch, on Tuesday Greenpeace <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/publications/Campaign-reports/Climate-Reports/How-Clean-is-Your-Cloud/">released a report</a> highlighting the dirtiness of many cloud utilities. They're writing more for consumers than developers, but are picking up on exactly the same issue of ubiquitous use of coal-powered data centres as we've been evangelising. We were also really pleased to see that technical coverage of the new <a href="http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/news/volta-london-data-centre-73590">data centre launch at Silicon Roundabout</a> included mention of the carbon impact of data centres.

We also had a great time on Wednesday at <a href="http://cloudcamp.org/london">CloudCamp London</a>, where the audience was full of interesting people and the Internet-of-Things themed talks were futuristically cool, even though not in our direct business area. I loved their red-carding rule for vendor pitches in particular, which worked so well that one of the panel introduced himself as just 'from one of the Evil Empires'.
