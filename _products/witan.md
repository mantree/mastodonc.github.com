    image: icon-decision.svg
    content: "Senior decision makers can see and stress-test detailed versions and variations of projections, to help them make more data-driven decisions."

    image: icon-scenarios.svg
    content: "Witan makes it fast and straightforward to test what-if scenarios where assumptions may change, for example seeing the implications of an increase in immigration for an area."

    image: icon-access.svg
    content: "Security controls mean that models can be seen and shared only among the colleagues who need them, without needing to be completely locked away from everyone."
